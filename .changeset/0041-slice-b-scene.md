ADR 0041 slice B: the turn context now carries real scene facts. `EndpointManagement` gains `inspectGroupScene` (name, owner, admins, member count, global mute) and `inspectGroupMemberProfile` (role, card, title, mute expiry; one lookup), implemented by the ICQQ adapter from uncached group/member reads. The CLI resolves them per turn (bot role always fresh; group and sender facts reuse a 60 s, 256-entry in-memory cache scoped to the generation; failures omit fields) and the inbound actor now carries `groupNickname` / `groupTitle` / `mutedUntil` plus the platform role. The Session / Bot state blocks are replaced by one projected scene line `[scene_id:…;scene_type:…;scene_name:…;owner_id:…;admins:…;member_count:…;global_mute:…;assistant_role:…;]` (values escaped and clipped to 64 chars). No new on-disk state.
