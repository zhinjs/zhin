Remove the unmounted classic Core `ToolFeature` and `SkillFeature` registries and the unused Agent bridge that copied them into a mutable resource hub. Tool and Skill authority now comes only from generation-owned Feature projections consumed by Plugin Runtime `CapabilityIngress`; Core retains only the stateless IM access predicate used by the current path.
