Remove the process-global Assistant, legacy orchestration, and session-tree registries. Host and Console operations resolve narrow projections exclusively from the request's generation-owned `AgentHostPort`; the Workroom major changeset removes `OrchestrationService` itself rather than retaining another mutable command authority. Shadow generations can no longer publish operational state before commit, retired generations cannot leak back into service, and Console no longer receives concrete mutable repositories, engines, ingress objects, or orchestration services.

Also remove the unused process-global bootstrap gate, connection authorization queue, session agent-state store, and the empty `@zhin.js/agent/connection` compatibility subpath. The inert state-authoring contract is removed in full: `defineState`, its public definition/discovery types, `DiscoveredPluginAgentSurface.states`, `AgentSurfacePluginInfo.states`, and `agent/state/*` discovery/reporting no longer exist. These experimental APIs had no production authority or lifecycle owner; connection authorization and durable state must be supplied by explicit generation-owned ports instead.

Remove the equally inert `defineDynamic` contract, `agent/dynamic.ts` discovery, process-global resolver registry, and per-turn prompt scratch field. Although files were reported as discovered, no production composition path ever registered them. Dynamic turn policy must be modeled as an explicit generation-owned projection rather than a latest-live module registry.

Make the Schedule `JobWorker` the sole owner of a narrow private `ScheduleExecutionQueue`, removing the public generic orchestrator `TaskQueue`, module-level latest-generation lookup, implicit queue/timer construction fallback, speculative DAG/priority/listener APIs, and the direct-execution bypass. Queue timeout and disposal now propagate cancellation through `TaskExecutor` into the Schedule Turn, retain their concurrency/lifecycle slot until the real operation settles, settle every queued waiter, and reject use after disposal. Remove the deprecated `AssistantJob*`, `createAssistantJobStore`, `getAssistantJobsPath`, `legacyDualWrite`, and inert `jobsFile` configuration surfaces; Schedule naming and the fixed `schedule-jobs.json` path are now the only contracts.
