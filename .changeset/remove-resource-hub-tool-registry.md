Make the generation `ToolIndex` the sole Agent Tool catalog. Remove the empty ResourceHub Tool registry, its builder and Capability Seam adapter, and stop merging its empty projection into Console introspection. Agent support resources now own only Skill, SubAgent, MCP, and Hook state; plugins register Tools through `tools/<name>/index.ts` or `context.addTool()`.
