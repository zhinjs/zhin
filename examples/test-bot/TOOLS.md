# Tools Guide

- After skill activation, call its declared tools immediately — no explaining or waiting
- Answers must be based on actual tool results, never guess
- On tool failure, try alternatives instead of reporting raw errors
- Use `spawn_task` for complex/long-running tasks
- Persist important info to `memory/MEMORY.md`, periodic tasks to `HEARTBEAT.md`
