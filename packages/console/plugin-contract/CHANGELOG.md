# @zhin.js/console-contract

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 75e26a6: Raise the supported Node.js range to `>=22.19.0` (was `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`). `@zhin.js/ai` depends on undici 8, whose `engines` require Node >=22.19.0; on Node 20 it crashes at import (`webidl.util.markAsUncloneable is not a function`). CI already tests only Node 22 / 24 / 26. `zhin doctor`, `zhin new`, `zhin migrate` and `create-zhin-app` now check for and write the same range.
- fdc2148: Unblock external plugin authors.

  - Published manifests no longer expose the source-only `development` export condition (it pointed at `./src/*.ts`, which is not in the tarball, so Vitest 4 and other tools that enable `development` failed to import Zhin packages). Each package now carries `publishConfig.exports` without that condition; `pnpm publish` swaps it in when packing, and the monorepo keeps source-level development.
  - `zhin new` no longer crashes without arguments (uses inquirer `select` instead of the removed `list` prompt; same fix for `zhin onboard` and `zhin pub`). The generated package.json uses `^x.y.z` ranges derived from installed versions instead of `latest`, declares capability packages as optional peers (plus devDependencies for local tests) instead of dependencies, sets `zhin.entry` to `./plugin.js` and builds sibling JavaScript on `prepack`, fixes the adapter template test, and adds `--package-name`. `--skip-install` now also skips the project-root install.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- fa542a2: Publish the accumulated Console page contract and schema documentation updates that were not covered by their original changesets.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fc6270: Reset all 88 published official packages onto the owner-governed 1.1.x stable line. Packages whose historical 1.1.0 version is still available publish as 1.1.0; packages where npm permanently reserves that version use the next available 1.1.x patch. Historical higher version lines remain installable but are superseded, and routine releases after this reset are patch-only.
