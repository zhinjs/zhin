### Patch Changes

- 63253bb: Restrict Root consumers to the read-only `SnapshotReader` lease interface and
  remove public `RootRuntime.controller` access. Generation commit, transaction,
  close, and stop authority now remain inside the Root lifecycle.

  Close Root admission when rollback cleanup or retired-generation disposal can
  no longer prove lifecycle integrity. Existing leases may drain, but new
  operations and generation transactions fail closed until the Process Host
  stops the Root.

  Bind externally driven capability resources to lifecycle-owned generation admission gates.
  Adapter candidates can establish Endpoint connections during readiness while their IM ingress
  remains invisible; snapshot commit atomically retires the old ingress and publishes the new one,
  without closing the old Endpoint before the transaction succeeds.
  Admitted HTTP, WebSocket, IM, isolated-RPC, Endpoint control, and Endpoint management operations
  now retain their exact generation until settlement instead of escaping with a live object.

  Remove inert unconfigured Endpoints and deferred soft-start. Configured Endpoint creation,
  connection readiness, and local admission are required generation prerequisites; any failure
  disposes the complete candidate set and leaves the previous generation serving traffic.

  Move the HTTP listener to Process Host ownership. Generation scopes now receive only an
  `HttpHost` routing port (without `listen`/`close` authority), and HTTP/WS registrations are tagged
  with generation admission so candidate routes cannot shadow committed routes before publish.

  Remove the fallible post-commit `openNext` phase and all pre-commit old-generation
  quiesce/resume hooks. Handoff now performs candidate readiness and reversible candidate cleanup
  only; the previous generation remains untouched until the single synchronous snapshot/admission
  publish point, then drains through its existing leases.
  Candidate setup, Feature projection, Endpoint readiness, MCP connection, isolation activation,
  database activation, and config commit now receive the Root transaction `AbortSignal`; Root Stop
  fails closed and awaits candidate cancellation cleanup.

## 1.0.8

### Patch Changes

- e40b048: Require generation leases at the IM ingress route instead of exposing a bare
  snapshot. Snapshot leases are store-owned, expose their active state, and can
  be rejected when presented to an Agent Runtime attached to another Root.

  Project configured MCP clients into the generation lifecycle. Configured
  servers must become ready during candidate activation; activation failure is
  fail-closed and leaves the previous generation serving traffic. Agent bindings
  filter the MCP servers visible to a turn, and MCP tools use owner-qualified
  `${qualifiedServer}__${tool}` names with fail-closed approval metadata.

- 2d0a159: 审计尾账清零（P2 批）：

  - Runtime：reload 前重读配置文档消除陈旧快照；组合式根 schema 显式报错（不再静默空 view）；ConfigPatch 支持数组数字索引（`endpoints.0.url`）；console 配置读写单一数据源 + 写入串行化；watch tick 防重叠 + fetch 超时。
  - Host/MCP：MCP client stop 成功才标记 + handoff 补 quiescePrevious/resumePrevious（独占端口不再新旧并存）；readJsonBody 超限保留连接回 413；dispatchHttp 统一 HttpBodyError 状态码；inbox endpoint 名仅命中才缓存；create_plugin 工具生成物改 definePlugin 新格式。
  - Agent：CapabilityIngress 按 projection 归属记账（key 振荡不再泄漏/误 purge）；敏感目录 `data` 锚定工作区根（src/data 不再误伤）；passive-group-buffer 死 key 清扫；tool scopes 数组校验。
  - 插件：blackjack 终局「回复 1」复活（getLatestForUser）；60s apiBase 改运行时求值（弃 process.env）；rss \_db lifecycle 清理；group-suite flush 不丢计数 + checkin 串行化防双签；milky SSE start 失败复位。
  - 工具链：applyAdaptersToConfig 改合并（重跑 wizard 不丢手工 endpoint）；html-renderer 提示识别 plugins 映射；create-zhin CLI 项目名校验 + task XML/NSSM 修复；setup --ai 补 @zhin.js/tool；layout 发现支持 .ts。

- fa66c4c: Add transactional setup-time Feature registration through `PluginSetupContext.addFeature`, with
  typed shortcuts for Adapter, Command, Component, Middleware, Agent, Skill, Tool, and MCP Features.
  Setup definitions now share provider validation, projections, conflicts, ownership, and generation
  lifecycle with convention-discovered capability files. Feature providers can declare their own
  shortcut through `authoring.setupMethod`.
