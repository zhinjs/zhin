# @zhin.js/im-contract

## 1.1.13

### Patch Changes

- 008ccad: Consolidate fragmented IM micro-packages (`@zhin.js/interaction` into `@zhin.js/im-contract`, `@zhin.js/ai-provider` into `@zhin.js/ai/provider`, and `@zhin.js/config-file` + `@zhin.js/isolate` into `@zhin.js/runtime`), and expose `zhin.js/schedule` convenience subpath.

## 1.1.12

### Patch Changes

- bc6ccb1: Deep audit bug fixes and 7 architectural improvements:
  - Sink Agent Turn ingress pipeline from `@zhin.js/cli` into `@zhin.js/agent/runtime` (`plugin-runtime/ingress/`) and decompose `ingress-route.ts` into modular pipeline stages.
  - Bind Session State Plane (`JsxButtonRegistry`, `InteractionRuntime`, `RuntimeInteractiveRouter`) to `PluginIncarnationRef` so active buttons and interactions survive unrelated-plugin HMR while expiring when the owning plugin reloads, and support per-conversation fallback numbering (`numberingScope: 'conversation'`).
  - Establish `conversation_events` as the canonical message SSOT and reference `conversation_event_id`, `conversation_key`, `platform_message_id`, and `message_key` in `agent_messages` (`AGENT_MESSAGE_QUERY_VERSION = 2`), threading `conversationSequence` across inbound and outbound delivery receipts.
  - Push down `DatabaseContextRepository` and `DatabaseScheduleJobStorage` full-session/full-table memory scans to indexed SQL queries.
  - Add kernel-level inbound `replyTo` and `mentioned` auto-promotion (`promoteInboundMessagePayload`) plus reusable `InboundDeduper` and `TtlLookupCache` primitives in `@zhin.js/adapter`.
  - Add `MiddlewareContext.dispatch` (`InboundDispatchSummary`) and `onAfterDispatch` hooks for `after-dispatch` middlewares, and support incremental rendering of in-place `envelope.payload` array mutations in `OutboundDeliveryRuntime`.
  - Unify `HistoryWindowTracker` and `AgentCompactionRuntime` token/message budgets (`resolveUnifiedHistoryAndCompactionBudget`).
  - Fix schema validation, database transaction connection cleanup and SQLite WAL mode, schedule timer wheel head-of-line blocking, security policy bash read paths and subagent guard propagation, group merge window permission carrier handoff, micro-compact namespaced tool matching, and WebSocket force-close / inbound segment mapping across adapters.

## 1.1.11

### Patch Changes

- 299863a: ADR 0044 C3: runtime consumers read capabilities instead of platform names. Scene facts (group info, member profile) are queried where the profile declares `scene.groupInfo` / `scene.memberProfile`; activity feedback (reaction, typing, status message, refresh interval, quote-only delivery) follows `feedback`, `actions.reaction` and `delivery.proactive` and the per-platform table is gone; large inline media is spooled only where `delivery.spool` is declared; the sandbox ingress and its console shell follow a new additive `runtime.sandbox` capability. `defineAgentTool` and Skill frontmatter accept `requiresCapabilities` (for example `actions.mute`), evaluated against the per-turn `TurnCapabilities`, so moderation tools disappear when the Bot is not an administrator and return when it is; the icqq/qq keyword boost in tool selection is removed and the icqq group-admin tools are tagged. The `icqq` command-line special case in the exec policy is now a generic `registerSensitiveExecCommand` rule registered by the icqq plugin. `EndpointCapabilities` gains a serializable per-kind `kinds` view. Adapters without a profile keep their previous behaviour (their derived profile also reads the management ports they implement).

## 1.1.10

### Patch Changes

- c15cef9: 修复 Node 22 内置 `node:sqlite` 读回 TEXT 时在首个 NUL 处截断，导致旧版（未编码）message_key 别名在索引投影中丢失、撤回前最高 revision 选错的问题；无法从返回行映射回别名时改为按 key 逐个读取并按查询归属。
- af8f803: Use the current Endpoint's platform profile for Agent account identity, with per-field configured fallbacks and scoped, identity-approved profile tools. Keep SOUL first-person and independent of account names. Profile ports preserve the source Client, cancellation, truthful update outcomes and private image authority.

  Adapter Feature API 2.1 and Tool Feature API 1.1 describe the additive profile requirements; new Core, official adapters and generated plugins declare the corresponding floors. Existing compatible API-2.0/API-1.0 plugins remain accepted by the newer providers. npm releases remain patch.

  Private IM assets now bind to the full canonical conversation and principal. Existing IM asset records that contain only the earlier lossy hash remain on disk until their original expiry, but cannot be safely rebound; recapture them. No automatic file deletion, platform profile mutation or workspace SOUL rewrite occurs during upgrade.

- 26fda97: Deliver validated final answers progressively through configured QQ C2C, Telegram drafts, Slack streams, Lark cards and Sandbox updates. Keep complete-message delivery for unsupported scenes, disabled adapters and outbound middleware that does not explicitly support revisions. Discord retains complete-message delivery.

  Preserve source-account leases, media order and confirmed delivery facts across cancellation, capacity rollover and follow-up answer phases. Preview drafts and uncertain outcomes do not become sent history. Bound each reply's semantic snapshot to 1 MiB, retain confirmed prefixes on failure and avoid replaying published answers.

  Project the latest confirmed message revision into paginated conversation history and synchronize Sandbox message updates across connections. Existing adapter implementations and complete-send callers remain compatible.

- 976886c: Preserve confirmed progressive reply content, routing and delivery evidence across cancellation, rollover and closing failures without replaying published text. Keep error dispositions and actual message references, and abort the owning provider request when its functional text consumer fails.

  Enable native Sandbox Markdown through the real Core projection so Console updates retain formatting in one message. Preserve instance-level streaming opt-outs, recall tombstones and multi-page synchronization. The first safe content is immediate; later updates retain the configured pacing, including large valid intervals.

  Keep Slack and Lark Markdown streaming within the current physical message. When continuation formatting cannot be verified, stop and retain confirmed content instead of replaying or silently changing it to plain text. Plain-text continuations retain their original reply route.

  Use rebuildable revision metadata and indexes in the existing conversation event table for bounded SQL history reads. Original event JSON and retention remain unchanged; older writers and models keep their compatible read path. Supported adapter streaming remains enabled by default, with complete-message fallback for disabled settings or outbound middleware without incremental: true.

- 032dc96: Only replay a failed scheduled task when its actual tool calls can be proven safe to repeat. Preserve committed or unknown effects, original attempt results and canonical delivery receipts instead of retrying the whole task after an observation or notification failure.

  Add generation-owned execution history for run times, attempts, basic progress, final output and separate delivery outcomes. Use the configured file or SQL backend, retain a UTC calendar month, and expose full-scope Console read and expired-history cleanup endpoints. Deleted task definitions do not delete their execution history; unfinished records are shown as unsettled or interrupted without automatic recovery.

  Keep observation writes independent of business execution. Coalesce snapshots through one bounded owner, including audit and optional activity projections. At most 128 completed runs / 16 MiB of unpersisted terminal snapshots are retained, including an in-flight snapshot; oversized or overloaded records produce visible recording gaps and never replay work. Shutdown does not wait indefinitely for an unabortable observation write.

  The optional internal Tool effect reporter grants no authority and does not require a plugin API floor change. Existing tools continue to work without it; undeclared effect safety is not inferred from their names or returned text. The Console execution-history UI requires the corresponding new Host endpoints; this changeset does not publish or deploy either application.

## 1.1.9

### Patch Changes

- c58c589: Group deferred tools by their canonical plugin or MCP server instead of installation paths. Omit already represented delivered text and ledger facts only from the current model projection, preserving full history and restoring facts when their covering reply leaves the active context. Allow tools to declare a synchronous, read-only availability predicate before turn disclosure, with execution-time checks remaining authoritative.

  Preserve every confirmed platform message identity across Agent replies and ICQQ split sends. Give each bubble its own stable single-message alias while retaining the reply's ordered association; preserve confirmed prefixes on partial delivery without retrying or inventing unknown message IDs.

## 1.1.8

### Patch Changes

- 4f96ad5: Fix member-join welcome display: icqq now sends the mention's display name as the `at` element text, the joining member's nickname from the notice is threaded into `target.name`, and icqq group messages populate `conversation.name` from `group_name` so `{group}` renders the group name instead of the group number.

## 1.1.7

### Patch Changes

- 69f9ef6: Scene awareness (#996): high-priority social events (bot muted/unmuted, join request, member joined/left, group notice updated, bot poked) now wake one short Agent turn on their own after a 3–5 s coalesce window (at most one wake per scene every 15 s), without waiting for the next human message. Low-priority events (reactions, card/title/remark changes, person-to-person pokes) never wake alone. Every turn carries the recent scene events as a short ephemeral `[Scene events]` block (≤5 lines / ≤200 chars) that is never stored in `agent_messages`. When the bot cannot speak, the wake only updates the session profile and skips the model, same as the session-profile speak gate. Configure with `ai.trigger.sceneEvents` (`conversations` defaults to `ai.trigger.ambient.conversations`).

## 1.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 6da2bad: 新增独立于日志的 Agent 用量分字段存储，默认保留 30 天；为消息与会话增加可查询身份及状态字段。提醒、管理员 RSS 和 Agent 计划任务使用事务化 SQL 表，迁移保留认领与回执，未知投递不自动重发。修复跨连接事务隔离、拒绝传播和 PostgreSQL 长度字段兼容。支持 SQLite、MySQL、PostgreSQL，升级需备份并完整重启，不能与旧版本进程混写。

## 1.1.5

### Patch Changes

- fbfefb7: Share segments accept `data.platform` (the song's music service: qq, netease, kugou, kuwo, migu). icqq maps it to the matching music app id when `config.appid` is absent and offers it to the Agent; adapters that cannot render share app metadata reject it like `audio` and `config`.

## 1.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 75e26a6: Raise the supported Node.js range to `>=22.19.0` (was `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`). `@zhin.js/ai` depends on undici 8, whose `engines` require Node >=22.19.0; on Node 20 it crashes at import (`webidl.util.markAsUncloneable is not a function`). CI already tests only Node 22 / 24 / 26. `zhin doctor`, `zhin new`, `zhin migrate` and `create-zhin-app` now check for and write the same range.
- fdc2148: Unblock external plugin authors.

  - Published manifests no longer expose the source-only `development` export condition (it pointed at `./src/*.ts`, which is not in the tarball, so Vitest 4 and other tools that enable `development` failed to import Zhin packages). Each package now carries `publishConfig.exports` without that condition; `pnpm publish` swaps it in when packing, and the monorepo keeps source-level development.
  - `zhin new` no longer crashes without arguments (uses inquirer `select` instead of the removed `list` prompt; same fix for `zhin onboard` and `zhin pub`). The generated package.json uses `^x.y.z` ranges derived from installed versions instead of `latest`, declares capability packages as optional peers (plus devDependencies for local tests) instead of dependencies, sets `zhin.entry` to `./plugin.js` and builds sibling JavaScript on `prepack`, fixes the adapter template test, and adds `--package-name`. `--skip-install` now also skips the project-root install.

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- b9b3953: Fix adapter connection races, transport health reporting, candidate rollback and delivery acknowledgement boundaries. Separate generation admission from locally observed connectivity, reject unconfirmed message receipts, and mark uncertain delivery results without recommending automatic replay.

  Class and compact endpoints should expose a `transportState` getter to report physical connection or local listener health. Unobserved endpoints now report an unknown transport and remain offline in diagnostics. Platform stability tiers remain unchanged until real account acceptance evidence is available.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 5b5d270: Complete the canonical share segment contract and preserve native ICQQ share delivery through Core and AI outbound pipelines.
- 36c2eb9: Add schema-driven database setup with explicit live-tested server and driver versions, validate environment-backed connection options before startup, and generate safe database examples for new projects.

  Make durable timestamp columns portable across SQL dialects, preserve dialect-specific identity syntax, migrate legacy inbox tables before their first millisecond timestamp write, and encode canonical conversation keys at the database boundary so PostgreSQL accepts them.

  Keep legacy durable conversation rows readable, normalize transaction results consistently, and make production mode select the matching environment overlay by default.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- e561309: Give each IM runtime one dedicated conversation owner for event-store replacement, inbound and outbound fact recording, notice normalization, reference lookup, context aggregation, and consumer cursors. Split the conversation contract into reader and writer ports so Agent and CLI receive only the read capability while Core retains mutation authority.
- 5c3858e: Make `@zhin.js/im-contract` the explicit zero-dependency owner of transport identities, canonical segments, media guards, conversation facts, stores, and delivery contracts. Platform adapters now read media contracts from that foundation instead of reaching through Core.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fc6270: Reset all 88 published official packages onto the owner-governed 1.1.x stable line. Packages whose historical 1.1.0 version is still available publish as 1.1.0; packages where npm permanently reserves that version use the next available 1.1.x patch. Historical higher version lines remain installable but are superseded, and routine releases after this reset are patch-only.

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 5969c5b: Remove legacy compound-string message targets and Endpoint control probing. Endpoint control and outbound Host operations now carry structured `MessageRef` identities. Endpoint send has one exact result contract (a platform message id), which IM Runtime projects into `DeliveryReceipt.message`; arbitrary result guessing is removed.
- 2f786bd: Replace text-only IM context and metadata-based quote handling with canonical
  conversation events, scoped reference resolution, explicit Endpoint content
  ports, and typed multimedia outcomes. Conversation notices are projected as
  untrusted context data rather than model-authority system instructions.
  The process-global passive-group buffer is removed: prior inbound conversation messages
  are now consumed from the same event store and cursor, with the current Turn
  message excluded from its own context projection.
  The unused `ConversationMemory` topic-memory runtime, its timers, legacy tables,
  and topic-window configuration are removed; `ContextRepository` is the only
  Agent conversation-history authority.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- c106ecc: feat(permission): add unified @zhin.js/permission package with builtin DSL (adapter/group/private/channel/user/role), PermissionHost, and platform permit checker. Extract LegacyEndpointControlSurface to im-contract. Support Unicode capability local names in plugin-runtime.
- a7df753: refactor!: Wave 2 架构债清理（ContentPart 终结 + 死面清剿 + agent 结构收敛）

  **AI 层**

  - `preprocessInboundMedia` / `buildSubagentInboundTask` 入参收窄为 canonical 单形态（ContentPart union 臂删除）。
  - 删除死面：`INBOUND_MEDIA_PARTS_EXTRA_KEY`、`userMessageToFilterText`、tool-policy `always/once/never` 别名、ContentPart `face` 变体、`describeVisionPartsAsText`；`processMultimodal` 等公网 shim 标 `@deprecated`（下个大版本删除）。
  - 测试桥归位：`createOpenAiCompletionsStreamFn` 及 wire 转换器移出公共 API（入 agent 测试目录）；`openai-bridge` 只剩 `assistantText`；`legacy-tool-bridge.ts` 正名 `tool-bridge.ts`。
  - 类型修复：`ModelApi = 'ai-sdk' | (string & {})`；`AgentTool.execute` 与实现对齐为三参（删 `as` 强转）。

  **core 层**

  - 死导出整批删除（均零引用）：`AITool`、撞名 `ToolDefinition`、`NoticeType/RequestType`、Interactive 别名全簇、`PermissionService`/`ConfigService` 别名、`getLiveEndpoint`、`qrcode-segment` 整文件；热路径不再自用 deprecated 别名（`resolveInteractiveSegments` 删除，改 `resolveKeyboardSegments`）。
  - im-contract 双 legacy 格式化函数二合一（`formatLegacyMessageRef` 为唯一公开 API）；ai-outbound 的 legacy `kind` 回退分支删除。

  **agent 层**

  - `ZhinAgentPrivate` 58 → 43 成员：死成员/零读取成员删除，deferred 族收敛为 `DeferredTurnState` 模块，三份手工镜像改为权威接口 Pick，`readonly` 名不副实纠偏，AutoContinueHost 单参化。
  - 4 个值导入循环解环（纯函数下沉 collab-utils / ask-user-format / memory-layers）；prompt 双轨收敛（3 个零调用导出 + 死分支删除）；死文件删除；`sandbox-enhanced` 挂 `@deprecated` 摘出公共导出；`tokenUsageToLegacy` 合一、`AGENT_ROLE_CONFIGS` 拆表。

  BREAKING CHANGE：上述删除项均为公共导出面的收窄，详见各条。

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- f8c7a54: fix: im

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- afc0e66: feat!: IM 寻址全量统一为 ConversationRef（BREAKING，无兼容双轨）

  - `SendRequest` / `IncomingMessage` / `OutboundEnvelope` / `EndpointSendRequest` / `RuntimeMessageEvent` 全部收敛为 `conversation: ConversationRef` 单一寻址；`adapter` / `target` / `parent`（ChannelParent）/ `DeliveryMessageGateway` / `synthesizeConversation` / `parseLegacyConversationTarget`（core 侧）全部删除。
  - 20 个平台适配器入站直接构造 `ConversationRef`（endpoint/kind/id/parent，guild 容器与群临时会话归位）；`endpoint.send` 改读 `request.conversation`，legacy 字符串仅存在于平台 SDK 边界内部。
  - `Message` 类改为 conversation 原生（`adapter`/`target` 字段删除，`id` 为 `message?.id` getter）；owner 判定、interactive 频道键、CommandMessage 鸭式契约同步统一。
  - OutboundHost / sendEndpointMessage / console RPC / inbox / activity-feedback / 游戏插件全部 conversation 化；`MessageGateway.send` 返回 `DeliveryReceipt`。

  迁移：自定义适配器/插件的 `gateway.receive` 传 `{ conversation: { endpoint: { id, adapter }, kind, id }, content }`；发消息处 `conversation` 替代 `target`+`channelType`。
