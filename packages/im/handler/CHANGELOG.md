# @zhin.js/handler

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 974772e: Replace the user-facing `Prompt` vocabulary with the `UserInteraction` authoring surface for input, confirmation, and selection. Commands and handlers now expose `interaction`; IM Runtime exposes `createInteraction`; schema-driven endpoint collection is named `SchemaInteraction`. The old prompt-named interaction types and properties are removed rather than aliased. User interactions render through one canonical Markdown and keyboard/list presentation module shared by commands and Agent `ask_user` turns.

  Extract the transport-neutral interaction contract into `@zhin.js/interaction`. A discriminated `ask()` API supports text, number, confirmation, single-select, multi-select, and typed lists with structured `title`, `description`, and `tip` content. Typed `sequence()` interactions return one result object keyed by step id, render progress, and retry invalid replies without leaking invalid values to callers.

  Preserve AI Markdown and card command actions through outbound publishing. QQ delivers Markdown with native command buttons; KOOK, Discord, Telegram, DingTalk, and Lark/Feishu now declare and encode their native Markdown dialects while retaining each adapter's interaction policy. Correct QQ callback button action encoding and button style mapping.

- 5969c5b: Add SideEventGateway so adapters forward notice/request/system into HandlerIndex. HandlerContext now exposes only generation-safe capabilities and prompt ports; live Endpoint escape hatches are removed.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- b9e6302: Map `handlers/**` path localName (`/` segments) to Lifecycle event names (`.` segments) when `event` is omitted, so `handlers/notice/receive.ts` listens on `notice.receive` without invalid capability dots.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- d3920e9: Extract the `handlers/` convention into a dedicated Feature package `@zhin.js/handler`, and mount it as a platform Stable Feature on `@zhin.js/core` (inherited by Roots via `platformFeatures` / `zhin runtime start`).

  Also add the `zhin.js/middleware` facade re-export so Stable Feature authoring is consistent with `zhin.js/command` / `adapter` / `component` / `handler`.

  `@zhin.js/feature-kit` is now kit-only: handler authoring, `HandlerIndex`, and the Feature provider entry are removed. Do not list `@zhin.js/feature-kit` in `zhin.features`.

  **Authoring:** apps and plugins that depend on `zhin.js` should import `definePlugin` from the main entry (`zhin.js`) and other `define*` from facade subpaths (`zhin.js/command`, `zhin.js/middleware`, `zhin.js/handler`, `zhin.js/adapter`, `zhin.js/component`) — do not separately install `@zhin.js/plugin-runtime` or the `@zhin.js/*` Feature implementation packages. Workspace plugins/examples/adapters were updated accordingly (imports + deps; child plugins keep `zhin.features` mounts and peer `zhin.js`). CLI `zhin new` / migrate cutover scaffolds follow the same rule.

  BREAKING CHANGE: `@zhin.js/feature-kit` no longer exports handler APIs and is no longer a `type: "feature"` package.
