## 1.1.10

### Patch Changes

- 2c3610a: Move account lifecycle ownership into the generic Adapter base and let native Endpoints retain their SDK Client inheritance. Infer platform-specific operation Sessions from a single adapter registry while preserving command parameter, option, configuration and factory inference.

  Bind message replies, management ports, login challenges and Agent cancellation to the captured account incarnation. Persist runtime account intent with encrypted, revision-checked Host storage; keep account management independent of Root process restarts. Require explicit operator confirmation before importing existing accounts, and give replacement accounts a new identity without inheriting previous Sessions.

  Expose account save, start, stop, update and replacement through the existing adapter Console, with exact account ownership, truthful pending/unknown outcomes and no startup configuration or environment-file rewrites.

  Complete the target migration across every adapter, the public authoring API, generators, examples and Console. This intentionally removes the old create factory, inheritable Endpoint/ClientEndpoint classes, Client descriptors and file-rewrite account management; plugin authors must use createAdapter, native Client inheritance and the single AdapterRegistry. Satori and OneBot12 require explicit platform/userId selection, and WeCom requires a separate agentId.

  Verify opaque credential changes before the same configuration snapshot is committed. Drain admitted native callbacks across close/rollback, cancel target work on stop, and keep raw transport parsing, platform ACK timing and SDK native methods under their existing owners. Account metadata conceals credentials carried in URLs.

- a9f4e48: PATCH COMPATIBILITY CUTOVER: this batch intentionally changes plugin APIs. The maintainer explicitly chose patch releases with declared version boundaries. Upgrade the complete tested dependency set; patch numbering does not promise compatibility with the removed interfaces.

  The first planned floors are zhin.js 1.1.19, Core 1.1.54, Adapter 1.1.26, FeatureKit 1.1.10, Plugin Runtime 1.1.18, Runtime/Isolate 1.1.16 and Agent 1.1.45. Keep old-interface plugins with the earlier locked stack until they are migrated. Adapter's independent Feature API changes from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0; official consumers declare ^2.0.0. Existing Feature API admission rejects explicitly incompatible ranges; omitted API metadata keeps its existing behavior and does not certify compatibility. Runtime engine and patch-only release gates remain unchanged.

  Use the native-Client Adapter target contract, canonical FeatureKit AdapterRegistry augmentation and named Endpoint control/management requests. Route message controls from canonical message/conversation refs; retain exact source authority and propagate caller/account/explicit-Root-stop cancellation. Replace removed Agent activity feedback exports with source-bound feedback. HMR pause/resume belongs to concrete plugin instances; plugins choose accepted-work policy without changing Controller commit/rollback authority. Cooperative worker/process control cancellation does not kill an isolate or reopen retired business admission.

  Provide authenticated historical-data preview, exact selected binding, transactional application, authoritative inspection and explicit resumption, including active games. Preserve before-images and journals; never replay an unconfirmed effect, infer an account from an alias, or reuse historical permission grants. Owner V2 approvals remain inactive legacy data, while new writes use V3. Rollback requires matching software, lockfile and verified data; installing old code alone cannot read a new V3 approval file. Conflicting after-images are never overwritten.

  See docs/plans/adapter-operation-version-boundaries.md and the Chinese/English upgrade guide for the complete version inventory, custom-plugin changes, acceptance and recovery sequence. These code and metadata changes do not authorize merging, publication, deployment, login, production migration or removal of installed workspace patches.

## 1.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 75e26a6: Raise the supported Node.js range to `>=22.19.0` (was `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`). `@zhin.js/ai` depends on undici 8, whose `engines` require Node >=22.19.0; on Node 20 it crashes at import (`webidl.util.markAsUncloneable is not a function`). CI already tests only Node 22 / 24 / 26. `zhin doctor`, `zhin new`, `zhin migrate` and `create-zhin-app` now check for and write the same range.
- fdc2148: Unblock external plugin authors.

  - Published manifests no longer expose the source-only `development` export condition (it pointed at `./src/*.ts`, which is not in the tarball, so Vitest 4 and other tools that enable `development` failed to import Zhin packages). Each package now carries `publishConfig.exports` without that condition; `pnpm publish` swaps it in when packing, and the monorepo keeps source-level development.
  - `zhin new` no longer crashes without arguments (uses inquirer `select` instead of the removed `list` prompt; same fix for `zhin onboard` and `zhin pub`). The generated package.json uses `^x.y.z` ranges derived from installed versions instead of `latest`, declares capability packages as optional peers (plus devDependencies for local tests) instead of dependencies, sets `zhin.entry` to `./plugin.js` and builds sibling JavaScript on `prepack`, fixes the adapter template test, and adds `--package-name`. `--skip-install` now also skips the project-root install.

## 1.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 4778587: 补齐 Console 安装配置闭环所需的精确配置路径、端点身份、平台就绪与验证计划失效语义，并保存历史消息的方向及实际投递诊断。

  修复真实 ICQQ 入站目标保存了插件 owner 而非平台标识、导致提醒投递被身份校验拒绝的问题；无关插件配置变更保留原有适配器连接。

  保证候选事件在当前代快照发布后准入，并避免安装过程中依赖文件变动提前中断插件管理操作。

  明确 Adapter/MCP 客户端创建仅提供所属 owner 的配置与资源，跨 Feature 查询由当前 operation 上下文负责；入站诊断记录接收时刻，避免慢指令的回复在历史中先于指令。

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 8740059: Standardize TypeScript capabilities on named module directories such as `commands/foo/index.ts`, `middlewares/audit/index.ts`, `handlers/message-receive/index.ts`, `pages/workroom/index.tsx`, and `mcps/filesystem/index.ts`. Only the fixed `index` entry is discovered; sibling files remain private helpers.

  Command route segments come from directories, while `[name]`, `[[name]]`, `[...name]`, and `[[...name]]` directories declare dynamic parameters. Plugin owners do not enter the route unless their config explicitly sets `commandNamespace`; Endpoint `commandPrefix` remains platform-owned and defaults to an empty string.

  Migrate the built-in adapters, plugins, examples, generators, migration tooling, hot reload classification, Agent authoring surfaces, documentation, and release artifacts to the explicit entry convention.

  Make Tool ownership and progressive disclosure explicit across all four supported locations: plugin-public `tools/`, Agent-private `agents/<name>/tools/`, Skill-private `skills/<name>/tools/`, and Agent-Skill-private `agents/<name>/skills/<name>/tools/`. Move adapter and group-suite operations that require domain instructions into their owning Skills so `load_skill` is the only path that unlocks their schemas.

  Remove the package-root `agent/` convention. Public capabilities now use named package-root directories, schedules use `schedules/<name>/index.ts` or `plugin.ts` injection, MCP connections use `mcps/<name>/index.ts`, Prompt Sections use `prompt-sections/<name>/index.ts`, Agent definitions use `agents/<name>/`, and permission vocabulary is published as `PERMITS.md`.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fc6270: Reset all 88 published official packages onto the owner-governed 1.1.x stable line. Packages whose historical 1.1.0 version is still available publish as 1.1.0; packages where npm permanently reserves that version use the next available 1.1.x patch. Historical higher version lines remain installable but are superseded, and routine releases after this reset are patch-only.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 974772e: Replace the user-facing `Prompt` vocabulary with the `UserInteraction` authoring surface for input, confirmation, and selection. Commands and handlers now expose `interaction`; IM Runtime exposes `createInteraction`; schema-driven endpoint collection is named `SchemaInteraction`. The old prompt-named interaction types and properties are removed rather than aliased. User interactions render through one canonical Markdown and keyboard/list presentation module shared by commands and Agent `ask_user` turns.

  Extract the transport-neutral interaction contract into `@zhin.js/interaction`. A discriminated `ask()` API supports text, number, confirmation, single-select, multi-select, and typed lists with structured `title`, `description`, and `tip` content. Typed `sequence()` interactions return one result object keyed by step id, render progress, and retry invalid replies without leaking invalid values to callers.

  Preserve AI Markdown and card command actions through outbound publishing. QQ delivers Markdown with native command buttons; KOOK, Discord, Telegram, DingTalk, and Lark/Feishu now declare and encode their native Markdown dialects while retaining each adapter's interaction policy. Correct QQ callback button action encoding and button style mapping.

- 5969c5b: Add SideEventGateway so adapters forward notice/request/system into HandlerIndex. HandlerContext now exposes only generation-safe capabilities and prompt ports; live Endpoint escape hatches are removed.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- b9e6302: Map `handlers/**` path localName (`/` segments) to Lifecycle event names (`.` segments) when `event` is omitted, so `handlers/notice/receive.ts` listens on `notice.receive` without invalid capability dots.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- d3920e9: Extract the `handlers/` convention into a dedicated Feature package `@zhin.js/handler`, and mount it as a platform Stable Feature on `@zhin.js/core` (inherited by Roots via `platformFeatures` / `zhin runtime start`).

  Also add the `zhin.js/middleware` facade re-export so Stable Feature authoring is consistent with `zhin.js/command` / `adapter` / `component` / `handler`.

  `@zhin.js/feature-kit` is now kit-only: handler authoring, `HandlerIndex`, and the Feature provider entry are removed. Do not list `@zhin.js/feature-kit` in `zhin.features`.

  **Authoring:** apps and plugins that depend on `zhin.js` should import `definePlugin` from the main entry (`zhin.js`) and other `define*` from facade subpaths (`zhin.js/command`, `zhin.js/middleware`, `zhin.js/handler`, `zhin.js/adapter`, `zhin.js/component`) — do not separately install `@zhin.js/plugin-runtime` or the `@zhin.js/*` Feature implementation packages. Workspace plugins/examples/adapters were updated accordingly (imports + deps; child plugins keep `zhin.features` mounts and peer `zhin.js`). CLI `zhin new` / migrate cutover scaffolds follow the same rule.

  BREAKING CHANGE: `@zhin.js/feature-kit` no longer exports handler APIs and is no longer a `type: "feature"` package.
