## 1.0.9

### Patch Changes

- 63253bb: Restrict Root consumers to the read-only `SnapshotReader` lease interface and
  remove public `RootRuntime.controller` access. Generation commit, transaction,
  close, and stop authority now remain inside the Root lifecycle.

  Close Root admission when rollback cleanup or retired-generation disposal can
  no longer prove lifecycle integrity. Existing leases may drain, but new
  operations and generation transactions fail closed until the Process Host
  stops the Root.

  Bind externally driven capability resources to lifecycle-owned generation admission gates.
  Adapter candidates can establish Endpoint connections during readiness while their IM ingress
  remains invisible; snapshot commit atomically retires the old ingress and publishes the new one,
  without closing the old Endpoint before the transaction succeeds.
  Admitted HTTP, WebSocket, IM, isolated-RPC, Endpoint control, and Endpoint management operations
  now retain their exact generation until settlement instead of escaping with a live object.

  Remove inert unconfigured Endpoints and deferred soft-start. Configured Endpoint creation,
  connection readiness, and local admission are required generation prerequisites; any failure
  disposes the complete candidate set and leaves the previous generation serving traffic.

  Move the HTTP listener to Process Host ownership. Generation scopes now receive only an
  `HttpHost` routing port (without `listen`/`close` authority), and HTTP/WS registrations are tagged
  with generation admission so candidate routes cannot shadow committed routes before publish.

  Remove the fallible post-commit `openNext` phase and all pre-commit old-generation
  quiesce/resume hooks. Handoff now performs candidate readiness and reversible candidate cleanup
  only; the previous generation remains untouched until the single synchronous snapshot/admission
  publish point, then drains through its existing leases.
  Candidate setup, Feature projection, Endpoint readiness, MCP connection, isolation activation,
  database activation, and config commit now receive the Root transaction `AbortSignal`; Root Stop
  fails closed and awaits candidate cancellation cleanup.

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- d5cd4aa: Publish Plugin Runtime entry points and convention modules as JavaScript so
  installed npm plugins load on Node without TypeScript stripping. Workspace
  development continues to prefer TypeScript sources for local HMR.

  Remove the unconsumed legacy game hub APIs from game-kit; game navigation and
  records now use ordinary convention commands owned by the game hub plugin.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- fa66c4c: Add transactional setup-time Feature registration through `PluginSetupContext.addFeature`, with
  typed shortcuts for Adapter, Command, Component, Middleware, Agent, Skill, Tool, and MCP Features.
  Setup definitions now share provider validation, projections, conflicts, ownership, and generation
  lifecycle with convention-discovered capability files. Feature providers can declare their own
  shortcut through `authoring.setupMethod`.
