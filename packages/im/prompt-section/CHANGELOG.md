## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 8740059: Standardize TypeScript capabilities on named module directories such as `commands/foo/index.ts`, `middlewares/audit/index.ts`, `handlers/message-receive/index.ts`, `pages/workroom/index.tsx`, and `mcps/filesystem/index.ts`. Only the fixed `index` entry is discovered; sibling files remain private helpers.

  Command route segments come from directories, while `[name]`, `[[name]]`, `[...name]`, and `[[...name]]` directories declare dynamic parameters. Plugin owners do not enter the route unless their config explicitly sets `commandNamespace`; Endpoint `commandPrefix` remains platform-owned and defaults to an empty string.

  Migrate the built-in adapters, plugins, examples, generators, migration tooling, hot reload classification, Agent authoring surfaces, documentation, and release artifacts to the explicit entry convention.

  Make Tool ownership and progressive disclosure explicit across all four supported locations: plugin-public `tools/`, Agent-private `agents/<name>/tools/`, Skill-private `skills/<name>/tools/`, and Agent-Skill-private `agents/<name>/skills/<name>/tools/`. Move adapter and group-suite operations that require domain instructions into their owning Skills so `load_skill` is the only path that unlocks their schemas.

  Remove the package-root `agent/` convention. Public capabilities now use named package-root directories, schedules use `schedules/<name>/index.ts` or `plugin.ts` injection, MCP connections use `mcps/<name>/index.ts`, Prompt Sections use `prompt-sections/<name>/index.ts`, Agent definitions use `agents/<name>/`, and permission vocabulary is published as `PERMITS.md`.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fc6270: Reset all 88 published official packages onto the owner-governed 1.1.x stable line. Packages whose historical 1.1.0 version is still available publish as 1.1.0; packages where npm permanently reserves that version use the next available 1.1.x patch. Historical higher version lines remain installable but are superseded, and routine releases after this reset are patch-only.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 54bfd6b: Introduce Prompt Sections as a generation-owned Plugin Runtime Feature. Projects can declare typed context under `agent/prompt-sections/`, select interactive or scheduled profiles and IM platforms, and govern presentation order separately from required/preferred/opportunistic budget retention. In-flight turns remain pinned to their original generation across hot reloads, required policy fails explicitly when it cannot fit, duplicate identities are rejected, and the previous mutable Agent-local discovery and platform contributor APIs are removed. ICQQ and GitHub platform guidance now use the same Feature instead of a module-global registry.

  Expose a content-free Prompt Section catalog through Console introspection, including owner, source, generation, profiles, and budget policy without disclosing prompt text. New AI projects mount the Feature automatically, and the full-bot example plus Chinese and English product documentation demonstrate the supported configuration.

- 09b14d6: Publish clearer package and authoring API documentation for generated references and editor IntelliSense.
