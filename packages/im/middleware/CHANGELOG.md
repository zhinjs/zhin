## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 8740059: Standardize TypeScript capabilities on named module directories such as `commands/foo/index.ts`, `middlewares/audit/index.ts`, `handlers/message-receive/index.ts`, `pages/workroom/index.tsx`, and `mcps/filesystem/index.ts`. Only the fixed `index` entry is discovered; sibling files remain private helpers.

  Command route segments come from directories, while `[name]`, `[[name]]`, `[...name]`, and `[[...name]]` directories declare dynamic parameters. Plugin owners do not enter the route unless their config explicitly sets `commandNamespace`; Endpoint `commandPrefix` remains platform-owned and defaults to an empty string.

  Migrate the built-in adapters, plugins, examples, generators, migration tooling, hot reload classification, Agent authoring surfaces, documentation, and release artifacts to the explicit entry convention.

  Make Tool ownership and progressive disclosure explicit across all four supported locations: plugin-public `tools/`, Agent-private `agents/<name>/tools/`, Skill-private `skills/<name>/tools/`, and Agent-Skill-private `agents/<name>/skills/<name>/tools/`. Move adapter and group-suite operations that require domain instructions into their owning Skills so `load_skill` is the only path that unlocks their schemas.

  Remove the package-root `agent/` convention. Public capabilities now use named package-root directories, schedules use `schedules/<name>/index.ts` or `plugin.ts` injection, MCP connections use `mcps/<name>/index.ts`, Prompt Sections use `prompt-sections/<name>/index.ts`, Agent definitions use `agents/<name>/`, and permission vocabulary is published as `PERMITS.md`.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fc6270: Reset all 88 published official packages onto the owner-governed 1.1.x stable line. Packages whose historical 1.1.0 version is still available publish as 1.1.0; packages where npm permanently reserves that version use the next available 1.1.x patch. Historical higher version lines remain installable but are superseded, and routine releases after this reset are patch-only.

## 1.0.13

### Patch Changes

- 09b14d6: Publish clearer package and authoring API documentation for generated references and editor IntelliSense.
- 1fc78bc: Unify native platform Client access behind the literal `adapter` discriminant. Handlers infer both native events and Clients, while command, inbound/outbound middleware, and both Agent tool authoring surfaces expose the exact operation-scoped Client through a lazy `$client` getter. Definitions without `adapter` keep `$client` typed as `unknown`, and runtime dispatch rejects adapter mismatches before resolving the Client. Bundled platform tools now use this single path instead of model-provided endpoint ids and adapter-specific dependency wrappers. Every adapter registers one Client/EventMap contract, and protocol adapters including NapCat, Milky, OneBot and Satori now produce transport-independent Client objects rather than letting Endpoint instances impersonate Clients.

### Patch Changes

- fa66c4c: Add transactional setup-time Feature registration through `PluginSetupContext.addFeature`, with
  typed shortcuts for Adapter, Command, Component, Middleware, Agent, Skill, Tool, and MCP Features.
  Setup definitions now share provider validation, projections, conflicts, ownership, and generation
  lifecycle with convention-discovered capability files. Feature providers can declare their own
  shortcut through `authoring.setupMethod`.
